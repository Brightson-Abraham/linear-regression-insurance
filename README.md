# 🏥 Insurance Premium Prediction

A machine learning project to predict medical insurance premiums based on personal and health-related features using a linear regression model.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build and evaluate a linear regression model that accurately predicts insurance charges using demographic and lifestyle attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc.

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Key Features of the Project

- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding and preprocessing
- Model training with linear regression
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R² Score
- Visual insights into the correlation between features and charges
